# Valentine Next.js App

A small playful **"Will you be my Valentine?"** page, converted from a single `index.html` file into a modern **Next.js** app.

## Getting started

From the project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Deployment

You can deploy this app easily using:

- **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify**
- **Cloudflare Pages** (with a Node/Next adapter)

The original static `index.html` is still in the repo for reference, but the live app entry point is the Next.js route at `app/page.tsx`.
